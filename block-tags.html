        <p>Here is an interesting story about a popular sport outside of the United States: cricket.</p>
    
            <blockquote>
                <p>A gutsy Beth Mooney has guided the Brisbane Heat to a three-wicket upset of the Sydney Sixers 
                to claim their maiden <abbr title="Women's Brazilian Butt Lift">WBBL</abbr> title at Drummoyne Oval. Laura Harris hit the winnings runs with four 
                balls remaining when she smashed a four between Erin Burns and Sara McGlashan.</p>
                    

                <p>After being set 132 for victory and needing five off the final over, Harris and Delissa 
                Kimmince guided the underdogs over the line against the two-time reigning champions. However Mooney 
                was the hero, defying illness to hit a match-winning 65 off 46 balls in front of a sold out crowd of 
                5,368 - and several hundred more watching from vantage points outside the suburban ground in Sydney's 
                inner west.</p>

                <p>After being outstanding behind the stumps during the Sixers' knock - taking two catches including a 
                ripper to dismiss Erin Burns - Mooney was visibly struggling in the stifling heat. The Brisbane trainers 
                on several occasions ran out drinks to the left-hander and she was frequently down on her haunches.</p>
